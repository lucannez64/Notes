## what i need to improve on
- watch vod and see what i could have done better 🚧
- aim past the enemy if they are moving so that they walk into the crosshair 🚧
- hold angles in a way that i can fall back to cover and it's unlikely that they go past my crosshair 🚧
- hold tightly if you have angle advantage and you're going slow ✅
- don't unswing if they don't peek at you
- improve my movement : jiggle peek 🚧 | wide peek ✅ | shoulder peek ✅ |  deadzoning 🚧 | burst strafing ✅
\
- spray at low ✅|mid range and burst at long range 🚧 (and tap at very long range ✅) make some movement between bursts
\
- when i have the angle advantage shift walk and hold tightly ✅
- peek by pre aiming the corner cleaning block by block ✅
