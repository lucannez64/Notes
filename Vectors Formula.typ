Here are some of the main formulas associated with vectors:

Vector addition: v + w \= (v1 + w1)i + (v2 + w2)j + (v3 + w3)k Scalar
multiplication: kv \= k(v1)i + k(v2)j + k(v3)k Dot product: v â€¢ w \=
(v1w1) + (v2w2) + (v3w3) Cross product: v x w \= (v2w3 - v3w2)i + (v3w1
- v1w3)j + (v1w2 - v2w1)k where v and w are vectors, and v1, v2, and v3,
and w1, w2, and w3 are the components of the vectors in the x, y, and z
directions, respectively. These formulas provide a way to manipulate
vectors using mathematical operations, and are an important part of
vector algebra and vector calculus.
