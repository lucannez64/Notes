# Notes

This directory contains my class notes and materials.

## Contents

- Course notes for various subjects like Math, Physics, Computer Science, etc. All notes are in Markdown format.

- PDF versions of the notes generated from Markdown using pandoc.

- Some source code files.

- Diagrams and images referenced in notes. 

## Scripts

- `update.ps1` - Automatically updates and compiles the Markdown files to PDF on changes.

- `notes_converter` - Compiles Markdown files to PDF and opens the Markdown in Neovim and PDF in parallel. (located on the separate repository) [Link](https://github.com/lucannez64/notes_converter)

- `pdf.ps1` - Opens the compiled PDF.

- `edit.ps1` - Opens the Markdown file in Neovim for editing.

- `mpf.ps1` - Shortcut to start notes in Neovim and PDF viewer side-by-side.

This allows me to efficiently take notes in Markdown, automatically generate PDFs, and reference both formats.
