== what i need to improve on
<what-i-need-to-improve-on>
- watch vod and see what i could have done better 🚧
- aim past the enemy if they are moving so that they walk into the
  crosshair 🚧
- hold angles in a way that i can fall back to cover and it’s unlikely
  that they go past my crosshair 🚧
- hold tightly if you have angle advantage and you’re going slow ✅
- don’t unswing if they don’t peek at you
- improve my movement : jiggle peek 🚧 | wide peek ✅ | shoulder peek ✅
  | deadzoning 🚧 | burst strafing ✅ \
- spray at low ✅|mid range and burst at long range 🚧 (and tap at very
  long range ✅) make some movement between bursts \
- when i have the angle advantage shift walk and hold tightly ✅
- peek by pre aiming the corner cleaning block by block ✅
