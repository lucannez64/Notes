The text, written by Raphaëlle Soffe and published in Times Higher Education in 2017, provides an insightful look into the daily life of a Harvard University student. It explores the rigorous schedule and high expectations that define the Harvard experience, shedding light on why Harvard maintains its reputation as one of the top universities globally.

Raphaëlle begins by addressing the common perception of Harvard's elitism and prestige. She clarifies that the university's reputation is not solely due to its history or exclusivity but rather the relentless hard work of its students. Every Harvard student dedicates significant time to studying and extracurricular activities, often working late into the night. Raphaëlle emphasizes that time is the most valued currency among Harvard students, who prioritize their academic and extracurricular commitments over everything else.

The text describes a typical Wednesday for Raphaëlle, starting with her first class at the Kennedy School of Government at 8:45 a.m. After an hour of studying in the library, she attends an economics class, followed by lunch and a research assistant job at the Weatherhead Centre for International Affairs. Her responsibilities include working with a postdoctoral fellow on voting habits and the suffrage movement in Denmark. 

After dinner, Raphaëlle takes an economics review test and attends the weekly Institute of Politics meeting. She listens to engaging debates, then returns to the library for more studying. Her day is characterized by a constant cycle of reading, writing, and calculating, with little time for rest. Despite the heavy workload, Raphaëlle notes that students still manage to find time for social activities, underscoring their resilience and determination.

This text offers a fascinating and vivid glimpse into the life of a Harvard student, showcasing the intense dedication and hard work required to thrive in such a prestigious environment. Personally, I find Raphaëlle's account both inspiring and daunting. It is impressive to see the level of commitment and resilience exhibited by Harvard students, balancing a grueling academic schedule with extracurricular activities and social life. However, it also raises questions about the sustainability of such a lifestyle and the potential pressures it places on students. While the experience may foster incredible growth and opportunities, it is essential to consider the importance of mental well-being and the need for a balanced life. This account serves as a reminder of the sacrifices behind the success and the relentless pursuit of excellence that defines Harvard's esteemed reputation.
